# Airline Customer Data Analysis

## 📂 Project Overview

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of airline customer data to uncover key insights and patterns that can help improve business decisions in the airline industry. The analysis was performed using a Jupyter Notebook, and the final insights and visualizations are compiled in a PDF report.

## 📈 Objective

The main goals of this analysis were to:
- Increase occupancy rate: Boost the average profit per seat and reduce the impact of current operational challenges by maximizing seat utilization.

- Improve pricing strategy: Develop a dynamic pricing model that adapts to market conditions and customer preferences to attract and retain more passengers.

- Enhance customer experience: Deliver a seamless and convenient journey—from booking to arrival—to stand out in a competitive market and build stronger customer loyalty.

## 📁 Files Included

- `airline_analysis.ipynb`: The Python notebook containing the full EDA process using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- `Airline_report_sub.pdf`: A structured PDF report containing the problem statement, objectives and summarizing the findings, insights, and visualizations derived from the notebook.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Pandas

## 💡 Key Insights and Recommendations

- **📊 Revenue Analysis Importance**  
  Analyzing key metrics such as:
  - Total revenue per year  
  - Average revenue per ticket  
  - Average occupancy per aircraft  
  is crucial for identifying profitability drivers in the airline industry.

- **🛠️ Strategic Improvements**  
  - Use data insights to revise pricing strategies and optimize flight routes.  
  - Increase occupancy rate to maximize revenue and reduce costs related to unsold seats.

- **💵 Pricing Recommendations**  
  - Reassess ticket prices for each aircraft based on aircraft condition and available facilities.  
  - Avoid extremes—prices should neither be too low nor too high.  
  - Implement a balanced pricing model to boost sales and retain customers.

- **✈️ Customer Experience and Safety**  
  - Efforts to increase occupancy should not compromise safety or customer satisfaction.  
  - Maintain a strong focus on service quality and regulatory compliance.

- **📈 Data-Driven Approach**  
  - Adopt a data-centric mindset in revenue optimization strategies.  
  - Data-driven decisions help achieve long-term growth and competitive advantage.
